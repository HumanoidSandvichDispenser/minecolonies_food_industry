# MineColonies Food Industry

This datapack adds Create mod automation compatibility for MineColonies food
items. It allows you to process and convert MineColonies ingredients using
Farmerâ€™s Delight crops and vanilla ingredients with Create mod machines.

## Compatibility Features

- Uses existing tags wherever possible (e.g. both Farmer's Delight and
  MineColonies onions are tagged `#forge:vegetables/onion`)
- Higher-tier foods can still be automated without a colony but require more
  intricate setups

### Crop Automation

MineColonies crops can be automated from existing vanilla or Farmer's Delight crops:

| Result | Process | Ingredients |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Bell Pepper | Mixing | Tomato + Carrot |
| Chickpea | Cutting | Pea |
| Durum Wheat | Pressing | Wheat |
| Wheat | Milling/Crushing | Durum Wheat |
| Garlic | Cutting | Onion |
| Soybean | Pressing | Pea |
| Corn | Mixing | Wheat + Pumpkin Seeds |
| Nether Pepper 2x | Mixing (Heated) | 2x Bell Pepper + Blaze Powder |
| Mint 8x | Cutting | Any Leaves |
| Peas | Mixing | Wheat Seeds + Mushroom |
| Butternut Squash | Mixing | Pumpkin + Potato |
